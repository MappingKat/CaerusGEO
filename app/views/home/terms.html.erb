Accepting the Terms</span></p><p class="P1"><span class="T5">By using the information, tools, software, features and functionality including content, updates and new releases located on CaerusGeo (together the “Service”), you agree to be bound by this Agreement, whether you are a “Visitor” (which means that you simply browse the CaerusGeo website) or you are a “Member” (which means that you have registered with CaerusGeo). The term “you” or “User” refers to a Visitor or a Member. The term “we” refers to Caerus. If you wish to become a Member, communicate with other Members and make use of the Service, you must read this Agreement and indicate your acceptance during the Registration process.</span></p><p class="P5"> </p><p class="P1"><span class="T5">You may not use the Service and you may not accept this Agreement if you are not of a legal age to form a binding contract with Caerus.</span></p><p class="P5"> </p><p class="P1"><span class="T5">If you accept this Agreement, you represent that you have the capacity to be bound by it or if you are acting on behalf of a company or entity that you have the authority to bind such entity. Before you continue, you should print or save a local copy of this Agreement for your records.</span></p><p class="P4"> </p><p class="P1"><span class="T7">2. Privacy and your Personal Information</span></p><p class="P1"><span class="T5">For information about Caerus’s data protection practices, please read CaerusGeo’s Privacy and Security Policy which is hereby incorporated into this Agreement. This policy explains how Caerus treats your personal information when you access CaerusGeo and use the Service. The policy may be updated from time to time at our discretion. Changes will be effective upon posting to the site.</span></p><p class="P5"> </p><p class="P1"><span class="T7">3. Description of the Service</span></p><p class="P1"><span class="T5">The Service is a personal finance information management service that allows Members to consolidate and track their financial information on CaerusGeo. Based on such information, the Service may also present information relating to third party products or services (“Caerus Offers”).</span></p><p class="P5"> </p><p class="P1"><span class="T5">The Service is provided to you by Caerus without charge (it is free) and is meant as an aid to assist you in organizing and managing your finances. It is not intended to provide legal, tax or financial advice.</span></p><p class="P5"> </p><p class="P1"><span class="T7">4. Account Information from Third Party Sites</span></p><p class="P1"><span class="T5">With the Service, Members may direct Caerus to retrieve their own information maintained online by third-party financial institutions with which they have customer relationships, maintain accounts or engage in financial transactions (“Account Information”). Caerus works with one or more online financial service providers under contract to access this Account Information. Caerus makes no effort to review the Account Information for any purpose, including but not limited to accuracy, legality or non-infringement. Caerus is not responsible for the products and services offered by or on third-party sites.</span></p><p class="P5"> </p><p class="P1"><span class="T5">Caerus cannot always foresee or anticipate technical or other difficulties which may result in failure to obtain data or loss of data, personalization settings or other service interruptions. Caerus cannot assume responsibility for the timeliness, accuracy, deletion, non-delivery or failure to store any user data, communications or personalization settings. For example, when displayed through the Service, Account Information is only as fresh as the time shown, which reflects when the information is obtained from such sites. Such information may be more up-to-date when obtained directly from the relevant sites. You can refresh your Account Information through the Service, in the manner prescribed in the associated instructions.</span></p><p class="P5"> </p><p class="P4"> </p><p class="P1"><span class="T7">5. Caerus Offers and Third-Party Links</span></p><p class="P1"><span class="T5">Some parts of the Service are supported by sponsored links from advertisers and display Caerus Offers that may be custom matched to you based on information stored in the Service, queries made through the Service or other information. We will always disclose when a particular Caerus Offer is sponsored.</span></p><p class="P5"> </p><p class="P1"><span class="T5">In connection with Caerus Offers, the Service will provide links to other web sites belonging to Caerus advertisers and other third parties. Caerus does not endorse, warrant or guarantee the products or services available through the Caerus Offers (or any other third-party products or services advertised on or linked from our site), whether or not sponsored, and Caerus is not an agent or broker or otherwise responsible for the activities or policies of those web sites. Caerus does not guarantee that the loan, investment, plan or other service terms, rates or rewards offered by any particular advertiser or other third party on CaerusGeo are actually the terms that may be offered to you if you pursue the offer or that they are the best terms or lowest rates available in the market.</span></p><p class="P5"> </p><p class="P5"> </p><p class="P1"><span class="T7">6. Your Registration Information</span></p><p class="P1"><span class="T5">You agree and understand that you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your password which, together with your LoginID e-mail address, allows you to access the Service. That Login ID and password, together with any mobile number or other contact information you provide form your “Registration Information.”</span></p><p class="P1"><span class="T5">By providing us with your e-mail address, you agree to receive all required notices electronically, to that e-mail address. It is your responsibility to update or change that address, as appropriate. Notices will be provided in HTML (or, if your system does not support HTML, in plain-text) in the text of the e-mail or through a link to the appropriate page on our site, accessible through any standard, commercially available internet browser.</span></p><p class="P5"/><p class="P1"><span class="T5">If you become aware of any unauthorized use of your Registration Information, you agree to notify Caerus immediately at the email address - </span><a href="mailto:support@caerusgeo.com"><span class="T8">support@CaerusGeo.com</span></a><span class="T5">.</span></p><p class="P4"> </p><p class="P4"> </p><p class="P1"><span class="T7">7. Your Use of the Service</span></p><p class="P1"><span class="T5">Your right to access and use CaerusGeo and the Service is personal to you and is not transferable by you to any other person or entity. You are only entitled to access and use CaerusGeo for lawful purposes.</span></p><p class="P5"> </p><p class="P1"><span class="T5">Accurate records enable Caerus to provide the Service to you. You must provide true, accurate, current and complete information about your accounts maintained at other web sites, as requested in our “add account” setup forms, and you may not misrepresent your Registration Information. In order for the Service to function effectively, you must also keep your Registration Information up to date and accurate. If you do not do this, the accuracy and effectiveness of the Service to you will be affected.</span></p><p class="P5"> </p><p class="P1"><span class="T5">Your access and use of CaerusGeo may be interrupted from time to time for any of several reasons, including, without limitation, the malfunction of equipment, periodic updating, maintenance or repair of CaerusGeo or other actions that Caerus, in its sole discretion, may elect to take.</span></p><p class="P5"> </p><p class="P1"><span class="T5">From time to time, Caerus may include new and/or updated pre-release features and trial use (“Sneak Preview” features) in the Service for your use and which permit you to provide feedback. You understand and agree that your use of Sneak Preview features is voluntary and Caerus is not obligated to provide you with any Sneak Preview features. Furthermore, if you decide to use the Sneak Preview features you agree to abide by any rules or restrictions Caerus may place on them. You understand that once you use the Sneak Preview features, you may be unable to revert back to the earlier version of the same or similar feature. Additionally, if such reversion is possible, you may not be able to return or restore data created within the Sneak Preview feature back to the earlier version. The Sneak Preview features are provided on an “as is” basis and may contain errors or inaccuracies that could cause failures, corruption or loss of data and/or information from any connected device. You acknowledge and agree that all use of the Sneak Preview features is at your sole risk.</span></p><p class="P1"><span class="T5">You agree that Caerus may use your feedback, suggestions, or ideas in any way, including in future modifications of the Service, other products or services, advertising or marketing materials. You grant Caerus a perpetual, worldwide, fully transferable, sublicensable, irrevocable, fully paid-up, royalty free license to use the feedback you provide to Caerus in any way. Caerus will not sell, publish or share your feedback in a way that could identify you without your explicit permission.</span></p><p class="P5"> </p><p class="P5"> </p><p class="P1"><span class="T7">8. Use With Your Mobile Device</span></p><p class="P1"><span class="T5">Use of these Service may be available through a compatible mobile device, Internet and/or network access and may require software. You agree that you are solely responsible for these requirements, including any applicable changes, updates and fees as well as the terms of your agreement with your mobile device and </span><span class="T5">telecommunications provider. CAERUS MAKES NO WARRANTIES OR REPRESENTATIONS OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS, STATUTORY OR IMPLIED AS TO: (i) THE AVAILABILITY OF TELECOMMUNICATION SERVICES FROM YOUR PROVIDER AND ACCESS TO THE SERVICES AT ANY TIME OR FROM ANY LOCATION; (ii) ANY LOSS, DAMAGE, OR OTHER SECURITY INTRUSION OF THE TELECOMMUNICATION SERVICES; AND (iii) ANY DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION TO THIRD PARTIES OR FAILURE TO TRANSMIT ANY DATA, COMMUNICATIONS OR SETTINGS CONNECTED WITH THE SERVICES.</span></p><p class="P5"> </p><p class="P5"> </p><p class="P1"><span class="T7">9. Online and Mobile Alerts</span></p><p class="P1"><span class="T5">Caerus may from time to time provide automatic alerts and voluntary account-related alerts.</span></p><p class="P5"> </p><p class="P1"><span class="T5">Automatic alerts may be sent to you following certain changes made online to your Caerus account, such as a change in your Registration Information.</span></p><p class="P5"> </p><p class="P1"><span class="T5">Voluntary account alerts may be turned on by default as part of the Service. They may then be customized, deactivated or reactivated by you. These alerts allow you to choose alert messages for your accounts. Caerus may add new alerts from time to time, or cease to provide certain alerts at any time upon its sole discretion. Each alert has different options available, and you may be asked to select from among these options upon activation of your alerts service.</span></p><p class="P5"> </p><p class="P1"><span class="T5">Electronic alerts will be sent to the email address you have provided as your primary email address for CaerusGeo. If your email address or your mobile device’s email address changes, you are responsible for informing us of that change. You can also choose to have alerts sent to a mobile device that accepts text messages. Changes to your email address or mobile number will apply to all of your alerts.</span></p><p class="P5"> </p><p class="P1"><span class="T5">Because alerts are not encrypted, we will never include your passcode. However, alerts may include your CaerusGeo Login ID and some information about your accounts. Depending upon which alerts you select, information such as an account balance or the due date for your credit card payment may be included. Anyone with access to your email will be able to view the content of these alerts. At any time you may disable future alerts.</span></p><p class="P5"> </p><p class="P5"> </p><p class="P1"><span class="T7">10.

For purposes of this Agreement and solely to provide the Account Information to you as part of the Service, you grant Caerus a limited power of attorney, and appoint Caerus as your attorney-in-fact and agent, to access third party sites, retrieve and use your information with the full power and authority to do and perform each thing necessary in connection with such activities, as you could do in person. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT WHEN CAERUS IS ACCESSING AND RETRIEVING ACCOUNT INFORMATION FROM THIRD PARTY SITES, CAERUS IS ACTING AS YOUR AGENT, AND NOT AS THE AGENT OF OR ON BEHALF OF THE THIRD PARTY.
